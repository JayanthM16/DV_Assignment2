In this project, we successfully implemented a Profit Calculator and Data Visualization using JavaScript, D3.js, and ColorBrewer. The key takeaways from this activity include:

1Ô∏è)Data Processing with .map() ‚Äì We efficiently used JavaScript's .map() operator to dynamically calculate:

Actual Cost = Raw Material Cost + Workmanship Cost + Storage Cost
Sold Price = Estimated Cost √ó 1.1
Margin of Profit = Sold Price - Actual Cost
2Ô∏è)Interactive Table Rendering ‚Äì The calculated data was dynamically formatted and displayed in an interactive table with:

Proper column captions
Conditional styling for negative profit values (red for losses)
Improved readability with padding, borders, and structured formatting
3Ô∏è)D3.js Multi-line Chart ‚Äì We created a data-driven visualization with:

Multiple lines for Estimated Cost, Actual Cost, Sold Price, and Margin of Profit
Proper scaling and axis formatting to accommodate negative values
Legend and color differentiation using ColorBrewer‚Äôs "Paired" scheme
User-friendly styling for better readability and grading compliance
4Ô∏è)GitHub Integration & Deployment ‚Äì The project is structured with optimized code for better performance, maintainability, and clarity. By leveraging GitHub, we enable:

Version control for tracking improvements
Easy collaboration with contributors
Future enhancements such as real-time data updates and interactive user controls
Final Thoughts
This project demonstrates how JavaScript, D3.js, and data visualization techniques can be combined to analyze and present financial insights effectively. By automating calculations, improving styling, and integrating interactive graphs, we provide a comprehensive data analysis tool that is both visually appealing and functionally robust. üöÄ

Next Steps: Implement additional features such as real-time data filtering, CSV uploads, and enhanced interactivity to make the tool even more powerful!
